# go-power

Just for fun

To initialise, we will do:

```powershell
go mod init projects
```

Thereafter, to run the scripts of the different projects, we can simply do so by running:

```powershell
go run projects/xxx.go
```

As an example, if we want to run the project script for the url_checker (under `projects/url_checker.go`), we can simply run:

```powershell
go run projects/url_checker.go
```
