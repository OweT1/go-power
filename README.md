The projects can be found in the `projects/` folder.

To run the scripts of the different projects, we can simply do so by changing directory to the respective projects and running the `.go` files. This command has been encapsulated in the respective scripts in the `scripts/` folder.

As an example, if we want to run the project script for the url_checker (under `projects/url_checker/`), we can simply run:

```bash
scripts/run_url_checker.sh
```
