# go-power

Just for fun

To initialise, we will do:

```powershell
go mod init projects
```

Thereafter, to run the scripts of the different projects, we can simply do so by changing directory to the respective projects and running the `main.go` files. In your terminal you can do:

```powershell
cd projects/xxx
```

followed by:

```powershell
go run main.go
```

As an example, if we want to run the project script for the url_checker (under `projects/url_checker/main.go`), we can simply do:

```powershell
cd projects/url_checker
```

followed by:

```powershell
go run main.go
```
