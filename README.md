The projects can be found in the `projects/` folder.

You should refer to the READMEs of any particular project for more details regarding their setup/execution.

## Environmental Variables

We will require the use of environmental variables for some of our projects.
To get a copy of the `.env` file, just simply run:

```powershell
cp .env.example .env
```
